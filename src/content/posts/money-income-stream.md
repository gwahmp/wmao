-------------------------------------

As long-time users of LeadsLeap, we've tested and validated these income features ourselves, from earning daily active bonuses to receiving recurring commissions as Pro Members. Our experience shows that LeadsLeap's system works without hype, offering genuine tools with transparent rewards.

Since its inception in 2008, LeadsLeap has built trust through consistent updates, user-first features, and timely payouts. Unlike other platforms, it doesn't rely on gimmicks or unsustainable models. Every earning stream, from Traffic Coop to PPC, has a practical use case backed by real-world results.

Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned marketer, the platform's clarity, lifetime tracking, and non-MLM structure ensure a safe, scalable, and ethical way to build recurring income online.

Why Promote LeadsLeap?
----------------------

Before diving into the income streams, let's talk why promoting LeadsLeap makes sense:

### Recurring Income

You earn 25–50% commissions every month your referrals remain Pro Members. That means a one-time effort can result in lifetime earnings.

### Evergreen Platform

LeadsLeap has been active since 2008, and it's not going anywhere. It's constantly updated and offers tools that marketers will always need.

### Sustainable Model

No gimmicks or hype, just solid tools that marketers actually use. This simplifies making confident recommendations.

### Lifetime Referral Tracking

Once someone signs up through your affiliate link, they are tagged to you for life. You'll earn whenever they upgrade, no matter when that happens.

1\. Affiliate Commissions
-------------------------

This is the main source of income for most LeadsLeap promoters.

*   You earn 25% recurring commissions if you're a Free Member
*   You earn 50% recurring commissions if you're a Pro Member

Commissions are paid monthly and become available for withdrawal after 60 days.

### Key Features:

*   You only earn from **direct referrals** (single-level, not MLM)
*   Use your **Affiliate Links & Tools** section to get promo materials
*   Check earnings via **[Affiliate Earnings](https://www.wikimint.com/affiliate-marketing-business-easy-steps)** and **Affiliate Traffic Stats**
*   View referral statuses in the Followers section

2\. Traffic Coop Earnings
-------------------------

LeadsLeap's Traffic Coop is a unique system where members send traffic to a shared Coop Link and earn in two ways:

### Coop Income

Earn real cash when others click the Coop ads you helped promote. CPM rates vary ($0.10 to $8 per 1,000 clicks), depending on traffic quality.

### Ad Credits

Earn credits that can be used to show your own Credit Ads, inside and outside the LeadsLeap network.

#### How It Works:

*   Promote your Coop Link in traffic exchanges, safelists, etc.
*   You earn credits & cash when real users view the link for at least 5 seconds
*   More traffic sent = more exposure and rewards

You cannot promote Coop Links inside the LeadsLeap network itself.

3\. PPC Earnings
----------------

LeadsLeap also runs a Pay Per Click (PPC) program, just like Google Adsense.

Here's how it works:

*   Place the Ad Widget on your website, blog, or LeadsLeap pages
*   When visitors click the ads, you earn cash and ad credits

### Earning Potential:

*   Typical rates range from $5 to $100 CPM (depending on traffic quality)
*   Earnings are calculated weekly, every Friday

This is perfect for [bloggers](https://www.wikimint.com/start-blogging-make-money) or content creators who want to monetize site traffic passively.

4\. Credit Encashment
---------------------

Let's say you're not actively running Credit Ads or you've accumulated more credits than you can use, you **can convert those credits into cash**.

### Requirements:

*   You must have at least 50 unused credits
*   Only available if you're not actively using them for ads
*   Once encashed, credits are removed and can't be used for ads later

It's a simple and optional way to turn excess resources into real dollars.

5\. Daily Active Bonus
----------------------

LeadsLeap rewards users who stay active, literally.

### How It Works:

*   View at least 10 ads per day
*   All the credits you earn that day will count toward your cash bonus
*   You keep the credits, they're not spent
*   The bonus is just a “thank you” for staying engaged

It may not be a huge amount, but it adds up over time and keeps you in the habit of staying consistent.

How Much Can You Earn?
----------------------

While results will vary, here's a realistic breakdown of income stream and earnings potential:

*   **Affiliate Commissions**: $5 to $500+/month (and recurring!)
*   **Traffic Coop Income**: $0.10 to $8 per 1,000 clicks
*   **PPC Ads**: $5 to $100 per 1,000 clicks
*   **Credit Encashment**: Based on available credits
*   **Daily Active Bonus**: $0.10 to $1+/day

**Pro Tip**: Combining [multiple income streams](https://www.wikimint.com/passive-income-ideas) can significantly increase your overall earnings.

*   **Promote consistently** using your affiliate links
*   **Embed PPC widgets** on blogs, review pages, or resource hubs
