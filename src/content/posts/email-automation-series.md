SendSteed's Email Series lets you automate follow-ups and build stronger relationships with subscribers through consistent and targeted communication.

Backed by Years of Proven Results in Email Marketing
----------------------------------------------------

Email Series campaigns have been a cornerstone of digital marketing for over a decade. Industry leaders, including content marketers, affiliate professionals, and online educators, consistently use automated sequences to increase engagement, conversions, and brand trust.

LeadsLeap's SendSteed platform, designed by internet marketing experts, simplifies this process while giving you the same powerful automation tools that top marketers rely on.

What is an Email Series?
------------------------

An Email Series is a sequence of pre-written emails that are automatically sent to your subscribers based on a schedule you define. It's also known as an **automated follow-up sequence**, and it's one of the most effective tools in [email marketing](/email-marketing-strategy).

According to EmailMonday, 51% of companies currently use marketing automation, and email series are the most popular use case.

Businesses that automate their email campaigns see up to a 451% increase in qualified leads, simply because they're showing up consistently and strategically.

Think of it as your virtual assistant that continues to nurture your leads 24/7, even while you sleep.

### Example Use Case:

Let's say you've created a 5-part eCourse. You can set your Email Series like this:

*   **Day 1** – Welcome + Lesson 1
*   **Day 3** – Lesson 2
*   **Day 5** – Lesson 3
*   **Day 7** – Lesson 4
*   **Day 9** – Final Lesson + Product Recommendation

Now, every new subscriber will automatically receive this email sequence starting from the day they sign up, without you lifting a finger.

Why Use an Email Series?
------------------------

### Build Trust & Authority

Consistent, value-driven emails help you establish credibility with your audience. Over time, they'll begin to see you as a trusted expert in your niche.

Automation is the bridge between effort and results. A well-crafted email series turns your marketing from reactive to proactive.

“Trust builds over time, but automation makes that time work for you.”

_— **Jane D'Souza**, Email Copywriting Consultant (10+ years experience)_

### Drive Sales Passively

You can weave soft pitches or product recommendations throughout your series, warming up leads until they're ready to buy, without sounding pushy.

### Save Time & Stay Consistent

Write once, automate forever. No need to track who received what or when, it's all handled automatically. Let the system handle the timing.

### Educate Your Audience

Whether you're onboarding new subscribers, teaching a concept, or breaking down your offer, an Email Series helps you deliver content in digestible, timed chunks.

Best Practices for Creating an Effective Email Series
-----------------------------------------------------

To get the most out of your automation, keep these tips in mind:

### Start with a Strong Welcome Email

This is your first impression, use it to:

*   Thank them for subscribing
*   Introduce yourself and your mission
*   Set expectations for what's coming next

### Space Out Emails Wisely

Avoid sending too many emails too quickly. A good rhythm might be every 2-3 days, depending on your niche and the type of content you're sharing.

### Deliver Real Value

Whether it's tips, tutorials, downloads, or tools, focus on helping, not just selling.

### End with a Clear Call-to-Action

Every email should have a purpose: visit a page, download something, reply, or take the next step in your funnel.

Share Codes: Clone Your Success & Empower Your Team
---------------------------------------------------

Here's where LeadsLeap really shines: Share Codes.

A Share Code is a unique feature that allows you to share your entire Email Series with others. This is ideal for:

*   **Team leaders**: Help your downline get started faster with pre-written campaigns.
*   **Coaches or mentors**: Share a structured follow-up series for clients or students.
*   **Affiliate marketers**: Provide value to your referrals by giving them ready-to-use sequences.

Anyone with your Share Code can instantly import your Email Series into their own SendSteed dashboard, saving hours of work and ensuring message consistency across your team or brand.

**Pro Tip**: You can combine your Email Series Share Code with Page Builder and Funnel Manager Share Codes for a fully integrated, duplicatable marketing system.

### Use Cases from the Field

Here's how real users are leveraging the Email Series feature:

*   A solopreneur in the health niche used a 7-day educational sequence to grow their subscriber engagement by 2.4x, all with one weekend of setup.
*   A digital product coach provided a Share Code of their Email Series to clients, helping them set up client onboarding in under 10 minutes.
*   An affiliate marketer bundled their series with a full funnel and generated 120+ sales in 30 days using a simple Share Code combo.

Real-World Examples of Email Series in Action
---------------------------------------------

*   **Lead Magnet Delivery**: Set up a quick 3-part series that delivers your free ebook, then introduces your paid offer.
*   **Product Launch Sequence**: Hype up your offer with a pre-launch email, a feature breakdown, and a final call-to-action.
*   **Mini-Course or Challenge**: Teach a 5-day skill, then invite users to take the next step (join your program, book a call, etc.).
*   **Affiliate Promotions**: Warm up leads with educational content, then introduce them to your affiliate product as the logical solution.

Expert Tip: Build Once, Profit Forever
--------------------------------------

Marketing veterans often say, **The money is in the follow-up**. With Email Series, you're building an asset that continues to engage and convert long after the initial effort. Just like planting seeds, your automated emails grow relationships while you focus on the bigger picture.
