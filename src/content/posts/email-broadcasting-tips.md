From my own experience running email campaigns, having both automation and instant-send options is a must, and SendSteed delivers both without the typical tech headaches.

That's where **Email Broadcasting** steps in, and LeadsLeap's SendSteed makes it super easy.

SendSteed's Email Broadcasting feature helps you engage your audience immediately with one-time emails for announcements, promotions, and urgent updates.

In this chapter of [Mastering Digital Marketing](/digital-marketing-strategy) with LeadsLeap, we'll show you how to use broadcasting to send real-time messages, and we'll also dive into two powerful automation tools: **Blog to Broadcast** and **YouTube to Broadcast**.

What Is Email Broadcasting?
---------------------------

An Email Broadcast is a single email sent to your subscribers, either manually or through automation. It's perfect for:

*   Announcing a product or promotion
*   Sharing new content (blogs, videos, etc.)
*   Sending time-sensitive updates
*   Keeping your list engaged outside of the regular automation flow

I've used broadcast emails for everything from real-time offers to quick content drops, and they've consistently helped maintain audience engagement during crucial moments.

While an Email Series is scheduled ahead of time and triggered based on when someone joins, **broadcasts are immediate or scheduled by you**, which gives you full control and flexibility.

Why Use Email Broadcasting?
---------------------------

### Stay Relevant

Keep your subscribers in the loop about what's happening right now, like launches, flash sales, or special announcements.

### Share Fresh Content

Email your latest blog post, video, or resource directly to your subscribers while it's still hot and relevant.

### Track Engagement

SendSteed lets you track open and click rates on your broadcasts so you can monitor how your content is performing and tweak future emails for better results.

One of my favorite features is the ability to see what's working in real-time, open rates and click-throughs help refine the strategy for better results over time.

### Target Active or Inactive Subscribers

You can choose whether to send a broadcast to active subscribers (who regularly engage with your emails) or include inactive ones (who haven't interacted in a while). This helps you segment and re-engage your audience effectively.

Blog to Broadcast: Turn Your Blog Into a List-Building Machine
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you publish regular blog posts, you'll love this.

Blog to Broadcast automatically creates and schedules a broadcast email to notify your list whenever a new blog post goes live. It works with:

*   WordPress
*   Weebly
*   Blogspot

As a regular blogger, automating blog-to-email has saved me hours each week. I no longer worry about manually notifying readers, it just works.

### How It Works:

*   The system checks for new blog posts **every hour at the 30th minute**.
*   When a post is identified, a broadcast is generated automatically.
*   It is then sent to your **Active subscribers** on the next hour.

**Example**:

If you publish a post at 1:20 PM, the system will detect it between 1:30 and 1:50 PM and send the broadcast at 2:00 PM.

If you publish at 1:40 PM, it misses the window and sends at 3:00 PM instead.

Want to speed things up? You can also manually trigger the system to pull your latest post and send it on demand.

YouTube to Broadcast: Auto-Notify Subscribers of New Videos
-----------------------------------------------------------

Just like Blog to Broadcast, YouTube to Broadcast automatically creates a broadcast based on your latest uploaded video.

If you're a content creator or using YouTube for marketing, this feature is pure gold, it ensures every new video gets emailed to your list without lifting a finger.

Speaking from experience, this feature is a game-changer for creators, it keeps your audience in the loop even if they miss your channel notifications.

### Works the same way:

*   System checks for new uploads every hour at the 30th minute.
*   Broadcast is sent at the next full hour if a new video is found.
*   You can also run this manually to send immediately.

This keeps your email subscribers in sync with your video content, no social media algorithm required.

Why Broadcasts Only Go to Active Subscribers (By Default)
---------------------------------------------------------

When using automated broadcasts (like Blog to Broadcast or YouTube to Broadcast), LeadsLeap targets **Active subscribers only**. This is to stay within system limits and ensure deliverability.

From a deliverability standpoint, this is a smart move, I've seen better inbox placement and fewer spam complaints by focusing on engaged subscribers.

Inactive subscribers can still be reached, just duplicate the broadcast and send it manually to them. This gives you full control over who gets what, while keeping your main list clean and compliant.

Smart Tips for Effective Broadcasts
-----------------------------------

After managing thousands of email sends, I can tell you these tips aren't just theory, they make a huge difference in open rates and engagement.

*   **Use compelling subject lines** to increase open rates
*   **Keep it short and valuable**, get to the point quickly
*   **Add a strong CTA (Call to Action)** that tells readers exactly what to do next
*   **Test and track results** using the built-in analytics
*   **Segment when needed**, target specific audiences for higher engagement

Final Thoughts
--------------

Email Broadcasting is your go-to tool when you want **instant communication and full control**. Whether you're promoting a flash deal, dropping new content, or re-engaging dormant subscribers, this feature keeps your list warm and your message timely.

Having used multiple email tools over the years, I find SendSteed strikes a great balance between simplicity and performance, ideal for marketers at any stage.

Plus, with Blog to Broadcast and YouTube to Broadcast, you get effortless automation for your content strategy, ensuring your best work doesn't go unseen. Overall, this email broadcast helps to ease the process of your [email marketing](/email-marketing-strategy) strategy.
