What Is the Funnel Manager?
---------------------------

Contrary to what many marketers think, LeadsLeap's Funnel Manager isn't a page builder or an automation tool. Instead, it's an organizer for your existing pages, a dashboard where you can group, label, and manage your pages based on the campaigns or products they support.

Think of it as a folder system for your landing pages, giving you the ability to create logical, streamlined funnels that are easy to monitor and scale.

We've personally found this structure invaluable when managing 10+ funnels across affiliate campaigns. It saves time and keeps our flow clean.

### Examples of How You Might Use Funnel Manager:

*   **Product A Funnel**: Contains opt-in page, thank-you page, delivery page
*   **Affiliate Offer B Funnel**: Contains review page, bonus page, bridge page
*   **Webinar Funnel**: Registration page, confirmation page, replay page

Instead of scrolling through dozens of individual pages trying to remember what's connected to what, you simply jump into the funnel and see everything laid out.

As a digital coach managing multiple products, being able to view an entire funnel layout in one place has made onboarding clients significantly faster.

What Funnel Manager Can and Cannot Do
-------------------------------------

### What It Cannot Do:

*   It does not create new pages, that's still handled in the Page Manager
*   It does not edit pages, editing is also done in Page Manager
*   It does not auto-link pages together, you must manually set links inside each page using the Page Builder

We've shared funnels with clients who imported them and launched within minutes, zero tech confusion, just results.

While some tools call this “funnel building,” LeadsLeap keeps it clear: Page creation is done in Page Manager. Funnel Manager is purely for organizing.

### What It Can Do:

*   Group related pages under one funnel
*   Help you strategize your [digital marketing](https://www.wikimint.com/digital-marketing-strategy) flow
*   Make it easier to find, manage, and scale campaigns
*   Allow you to share entire funnels with others using Share Codes

Why Use Funnel Manager?
-----------------------

### Keep Pages Organized

If you promote multiple products or run multiple lead gen campaigns, the number of pages you create can add up fast. Funnel Manager lets you assign each page to a relevant funnel, so you'll never wonder “what was this page for again?”

When consulting small teams, we've seen campaigns go from chaotic to crystal-clear just by assigning pages into named funnels.

### Visualize Your Strategy

Seeing all your pages grouped in a funnel allows you to map out the entire customer journey, from opt-in to sale, to follow-up offers. This helps you stay strategic and improve your conversions.

This visual clarity isn't just helpful, it's essential when running A/B tests or optimizing upsell paths across multiple campaigns.

### Duplicate & Share Funnels With Teams

Got a high-converting funnel you want your team, referrals, or clients to use? With Funnel Manager, you can generate a Share Code and let others instantly clone your entire setup, including pages and popups.

It's perfect for:

*   Affiliate programs
*   Coaching clients
*   Downline support
*   JV partnerships

As an agency, we rely on this feature to onboard clients fast, handing them done-for-you funnels they can customize in under an hour.

Use Case Scenarios
------------------

Here's how marketers like you can use Funnel Manager in the real world:

### Affiliate Marketers

You've built several promo pages for different products. Now, group each set under its own funnel and easily track or update them as needed.

### Digital Product Creators

Each course or eBook you sell comes with its own opt-in page, confirmation page, and delivery page. Funnel Manager lets you organize them like chapters in a book.

### Team Leaders or Coaches

Build one master funnel and share it with your team using a Share Code. Now they can duplicate your exact campaign and personalize it in minutes.

We've used this with new affiliates, giving them structured, proven pages instead of letting them guess what works.

Funnel Manager + Share Code = Scalable Systems
----------------------------------------------

The real power of Funnel Manager kicks in when combined with Share Codes. This feature lets you package up an entire funnel, complete with pages, popups, and flow, and hand it off to someone else.

They can import it into their LeadsLeap account and start marketing instantly, using your proven setup.

From personal experience, this has reduced our setup time by 80% when deploying campaigns across partner accounts.

It's like handing your team a fully loaded toolkit instead of asking them to build from scratch.

Final Thoughts
--------------

LeadsLeap's Funnel Manager isn't about flashy drag-and-drop animations or auto-linking flows. Instead, it focuses on organization, strategy, and scalability, the things that truly matter when you're running multiple campaigns and leading a team.

If you've already built several pages, Funnel Manager is your next logical step to stay in control, work smarter, and scale faster.
