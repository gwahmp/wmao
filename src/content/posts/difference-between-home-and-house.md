Where to use home and house
---------------------------

If it is our own living place, the word HOME has to be used. For example:

![A home is made of love, affection, and cherished moments. Create a space filled with warmth and care for lasting memories.](/assets/images/blog/home-with-love-affection.webp "Home is Made of Love and Affection")

*   I go home
*   She is going home
*   He will be going home.

Note: The word HOME does not have any preposition.

If it is a place of a third person including our relatives, the word HOUSE is to be used. For example:

![A house is made of bricks and sand, but a home is built with love, care, and memories that last a lifetime.](/assets/images/blog/house-made-with-bricks-sand.webp "House is Made of Bricks and Sand")

*   Every Sunday, I go to my uncle's house
*   She is going to her grandma's house
*   He is going to his friend's house
