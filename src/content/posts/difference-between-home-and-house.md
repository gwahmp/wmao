Where to use home and house
---------------------------

If it is our own living place, the word HOME has to be used. For example:

![A home is made of love, affection, and cherished moments. Create a space filled with warmth and care for lasting memories.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgn35gTHFfX3va-LJp-mcx6i64jLEpM2w7iZ8PxZr8iE1xxIEAVWi1wF7eoi_YbvoJFzqgOTu4M0vEisCBHWO0WivAkdlfIWueH8MdR-F35qegvkYJZM0sfb9AJquLeXta6mf_gLw8WljbxfotZNxvzHelm2HusnXZTq-XWl9_pyqlrdNL-c_wi1vSXlR7Y/s1600/home-with-love-affection.webp "Home is Made of Love and Affection")

*   I go home
*   She is going home
*   He will be going home.

Note: The word HOME does not have any preposition.

If it is a place of a third person including our relatives, the word HOUSE is to be used. For example:

![A house is made of bricks and sand, but a home is built with love, care, and memories that last a lifetime.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgER2VLYymjImCXeQib5kDSl5oC9I4qhSQA8mjLWZKohlcuKoL2pKDUhgxY1EDEyo6D7OKBuhp9795BCvKXm0wOKgTwoNMFlT7EPwQ68KprfiFdhNQg8NWJkJGmcm_ya3h9HWhvd1SH9NwSnirdTxbq7SPYe7h3EHXb7-q7Cf9YG9fPniEMSxU0vfI5gUF4/s1600/house-made-with-bricks-sand.webp "House is Made of Bricks and Sand")

*   She is going to her grandma's house
*   He is going to his friend's house
