        <li>Register your business name and establish a legal business entity like an LLC. Obtain necessary licenses and permits.</li>
        <li>Set up business basics like a website, email, <a href="https://developer.wikimint.com/2023/10/top-social-media-networking-sites.html">social media accounts</a>, and branding assets. Have a way to accept payments.</li>

  - q: |
      How much does it cost and what is the initial investment required to establish an online business?
    a: |
      Initial costs vary widely depending on your business model, inventory requirements, website needs, and more. However, you can launch many online businesses for less than $500 initially. Ecommerce businesses have more start-up costs for website development and establishing inventory. The most budget-friendly options are service-based businesses like freelancing, coaching, and consulting that rely on your skills and time.

  - q: |
      How long does it take to become profitable?
    a: |
      Most online businesses take 4-12 months to start generating a consistent profit. Some like freelancing services may become profitable more quickly by taking on clients immediately.

Give your online business 12-24 months to start seeing more significant monthly revenue potential.

  - q: |
      What legal requirements do online businesses need to follow?

      Even online businesses need to meet local and state legal compliance requirements depending on where you are located or have customers.
