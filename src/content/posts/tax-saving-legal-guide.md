### Health Savings & Insurance

### Take Advantage of Capital Gains Tax Exemptions

Tax Saving Methods in India (Legally and Effectively)
-----------------------------------------------------

In India, tax-saving is a popular financial sport. Salaried individuals, [business owners](/startup-business-guide), freelancers - everyone wants to know **How do I save more tax?** Let's decode the most effective and legal tax saving options in India under the current Income Tax laws.

India offers a range of tax deductions and exemptions under the Income Tax Act, 1961. Here's a look at how you can cut down your taxes while staying within legal limits:

### Use Section 80C to Your Advantage

Under Section 80C, you can claim deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh per financial year. Eligible investments include:

*   Public Provident Fund (PPF)
*   Employees' Provident Fund (EPF)
*   National Savings Certificate (NSC)
*   Life insurance premiums
*   Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS)
*   5-year tax-saving fixed deposits
*   Children's tuition fees
*   Principal repayment on home loan
*   ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Schemes)

**Maximum Deduction Allowed**: ₹1.5 lakh per financial year.

**Example scenario**: Ravi, a salaried professional in Mumbai, invested ₹1.5 lakh in PPF and ELSS. Not only did his money grow over time, but he also saved ₹46,800 in taxes (assuming 30% slab). Smart, right?

### Additional Deductions Beyond 80C

Here are other popular sections you can leverage:

*   **Section 80D**: Health insurance premiums (up to ₹25,000 for self & ₹50,000 for parents)
*   **Section 80E**: Interest on education loans
*   **Section 24(b)**: Deduction of up to ₹2 lakh is allowed on interest paid for a home loan.
*   **Section 80G**: Donations to charitable organizations

#### Section 80D – Health Insurance Benefits

*   Deduction up to ₹25,000 for self and family.
*   Additional ₹25,000 for parents (₹50,000 if they're senior citizens).

So, if you pay health insurance for yourself and senior citizen parents, you can **claim up to ₹75,000 as a deduction**!

#### Section 80E – Education Loan Interest

Dreaming of studying abroad or sending your child to a top college? You can claim **unlimited deduction on interest** paid for education loans - for up to 8 years.

#### House Loan Interest – Section 24(b)

Under this, you can claim **up to ₹2 lakh deduction on interest paid on home loan** for a self-occupied property. Combine this with Section 80C (for principal repayment), and you're saving even more.

#### NPS – National Pension Scheme

Additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1B) on top of 80C limit. Great for retirement planning, and even better for tax saving.

#### Use the HRA (House Rent Allowance) Exemption

If you're a salaried employee living in a rented house, you can claim HRA exemption under Section 10(13A). The amount depends on:

*   Your salary
*   HRA received
*   Rent paid
*   City of residence
*   Whether you live in a metro city

**Note**: You must keep rent receipts and a rent agreement.

#### Opt for the New Tax Regime (if suitable)

India offers **two tax regimes**:

*   **Old regime**: Higher tax slabs, but includes deductions and exemptions
*   **New regime**: Lower tax rates, but no major exemptions

Run the numbers or consult a CA to see which one benefits you more.
