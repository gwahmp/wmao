Understanding Investment Basics

Before diving into investment options, let's understand what investment means:

Investing is the process of allocating your money in assets or schemes that can generate profits or grow in value over time. The key is to balance risk and reward based on your financial goals.

### Types of Investments

6.  **SIP Investments** – Systematic investment plans in mutual funds for disciplined investing.
7.  **Post Office Schemes** – Secure and government-backed plans.

Best Strategies for High Growth and Safety

*   Allocate 30% to debt instruments like FDs or government bonds.
*   Keep 20% in gold as a safety net.
*   Use 10% for liquid funds or emergency savings.

**Example**: Suppose you invest ₹10 lakhs. Divide it as ₹4 lakhs in equity mutual funds, ₹3 lakhs in FDs, ₹2 lakhs in gold, and ₹1 lakh in liquid funds. This strategy ensures both safety and growth.
