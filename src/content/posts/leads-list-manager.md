**The money is in the list.**

However, the real secret that often goes unmentioned is that the value of a list comes from the relationships within it.

And that's exactly the mindset LeadsLeap's **List Manager**, also known as SendSteed, is built on.

![Build and manage your email list effectively using SendSteed's List Manager, an all-in-one tool for automation, segmentation, and subscriber engagement.  ](/assets/images/blog/list-manager-email-marketing.webp "Building Your List with the List Manager (SendSteed)")

SendSteed's List Manager helps you grow and nurture your email list with powerful tools for automation, broadcast, and audience segmentation.

In this chapter of Mastering [Digital Marketing](/digital-marketing-strategy) with LeadsLeap, we'll explore how SendSteed helps you build, nurture, and monetize your email list the right way, without spammy shortcuts or overpriced tools.

As someone who has tested various autoresponders over the years, from Mailchimp to GetResponse, I can confidently say that SendSteed simplifies the entire process without compromising on features. Whether you're a seasoned or a beginner email marketer, you'll appreciate the control and compliance SendSteed offers.

What Is SendSteed?
------------------

**SendSteed** is LeadsLeap's built-in, fully functional **email autoresponder and list management system**. It's free for all members and designed to help you:

*   Collect leads using opt-in forms
*   Send automated follow-up emails (Email Series)
*   Broadcast messages to your entire list
*   Maintain legal compliance with double opt-in
*   Build trust and long-term engagement

I've personally used SendSteed to build multiple niche-specific lists and run high-conversion campaigns. Its reliability and ease of use have helped me grow an engaged subscriber base without needing expensive third-party platforms.

You might know similar tools by other names:

Autoresponders, email automation systems, CRM tools, or list managers. SendSteed does what platforms like Aweber, Mailchimp, and GetResponse do, without the monthly fees.

Why Every Marketer Needs a List
-------------------------------

Let's be clear: list building is not optional if you're serious about long-term success. Paid ads can disappear. Social media platforms can ban or throttle your reach. But your email list is an owned audience.

Before jumping into SendSteed, though, ask yourself:

*   What niche should I build my list in?
*   What value am I offering to subscribers?
*   Do I have an enticing opt-in gift (like an ebook, checklist, or course)?
*   Am I prepared to communicate consistently?
*   Do I have products or services that can be promoted long-term (evergreen offers)?

Remember: **building a list is building a relationship**, not a hit-and-run promo. If you're not ready to nurture that connection, it's best to wait until you are.

How SendSteed Works
-------------------

Here's a simplified flow of how SendSteed supports your list-building and email marketing:

### Subscribers Opt-In

When someone signs up via your opt-in form (created in LeadsLeap), they receive a Verification Email and a Welcome Email.

### Double Opt-In Confirmation

Once the subscriber opens either email, their email is marked as verified, ensuring your list stays clean and compliant.

### Email Series

You can schedule a sequence of follow-up emails that go out automatically over time (daily, every few days, or your custom interval). Great for onboarding, education, or sales nurturing.

### Email Broadcasts

Got a new blog post, product launch, or limited-time offer? You can email your entire list or segment of subscribers instantly using the broadcast function.

What Makes SendSteed Different?
-------------------------------

### 100% Privacy-Respecting

LeadsLeap doesn't share or resell any emails. The leads you collect are yours and yours only. They're not visible to LeadsLeap or other members, and your subscribers are not added to any global or shared pool.

### Legitimate, Quality List Only

SendSteed encourages you to build your own genuine list, not a safelist, shared list, or purchased list. That's essential for maintaining compliance with CAN-SPAM and GDPR regulations.

### Powerful Email Editor

SendSteed comes with an intuitive editor with custom features like:

*   **Preview mode** to see your email exactly as it will appear
*   **Send test** to yourself before going live
*   **PDF gallery** designed to host and share lead magnets (available in Pro plan)
*   **Image gallery** and template blocks for visual content
*   **Signature settings** to maintain consistency

Everything you need to **create professional, engaging emails**, right inside the LeadsLeap dashboard.

In today's digital landscape, ethical list building isn't just good practice, it's essential. SendSteed enforces double opt-in and gives you full control over your subscribers, which means better deliverability, lower spam complaints, and stronger subscriber trust.

Understanding Different Types of Lists (And What NOT to Do)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Not all email lists are created equal. Here's a breakdown of common list types and why only one of them is truly valuable:

### Safelist

Emails shared by a program where everyone agrees to receive promotional messages. Valid only inside the platform, not usable for your own [email marketing](/email-marketing-strategy).

### Shared List

Contacts you gain through referrals inside another program. They may not even know who you are, dangerous territory legally and ethically.

### Pseudo List

Subscribers who opt in without knowing you personally or clearly understanding what they signed up for. High spam risk, low engagement.

### Purchased List

Bought from someone else. Legally risky, poor deliverability, and often outright spam.

### Your Own List (the SendSteed way)

Subscribers who opt in to your specific offer, know who you are, and have verified their email address.

One of my lists built entirely using SendSteed now brings in a steady stream of affiliate sales each month. It didn't happen overnight, but by consistently providing value and using the tools inside SendSteed, that list became an asset I can count on.

This is the only kind of list that gives you real influence, trust, and [long-term income potential](/passive-income-ideas).

For example, I created a simple opt-in funnel offering a free SEO checklist. Using SendSteed's tools, I followed up with a 5-part email series on website optimization. The result? A 38% open rate and multiple requests for consulting, proving how effective well-managed lists can be.

Best Practices for Building and Managing Your List
--------------------------------------------------

*   **Offer real value** in your opt-in. Free PDFs, email courses, or exclusive tips work well.
*   **Stay consistent** with your follow-up. Don't ghost your list.
*   **Be transparent**, tell people what they're signing up for.
*   **Use segmentation** and personalization whenever possible.
*   **Test and tweak** your Email Series and broadcasts for better performance.
*   **Always provide an unsubscribe option** (SendSteed handles this automatically).

Final Thoughts
--------------

SendSteed is more than just an email tool, it's your direct line to a community of potential buyers, fans, and brand advocates. By building your list with integrity and offering real value, you set yourself up for consistent, long-term success.

And the best part? You can begin without investing any money upfront.

Unlike many platforms that lure you in with a free plan and then aggressively upsell, LeadsLeap's SendSteed remains transparent. You get full functionality as a free member, with optional upgrades only when you're ready to scale.

In the next chapter, we'll cover Email Series, how to keep your list warm and engaged with automated pre-created series of emails periodically.
