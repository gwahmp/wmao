What is Momentum Investing?
---------------------------

Discover the basics of momentum investing and how to leverage rising stocks for profitable market gains.

### Momentum Investing Meaning Explained

In simple terms, momentum investors focus on stocks with upward or downward price trends. By riding these trends, they aim to maximize short- or medium-term returns.

For instance, if a stock has risen 10% over the last three months due to strong earnings, a momentum investor might buy the stock, expecting the trend to continue.

Key Momentum Investing Strategies
---------------------------------

There are several strategies that traders use to apply momentum investing effectively. Here are the most common ones:

### Relative Strength Strategy

This involves comparing the performance of stocks against their peers or a market index. Investors focus on stocks that show higher relative strength.

**Example**: A stock in the technology sector that outperforms other tech stocks during a market rally may be selected for a momentum portfolio.

### Moving Averages

Investors use moving averages (like 50-day or 200-day) to identify price trends. A stock crossing above its moving average may signal a buy opportunity.

### Earnings Momentum

Stocks with strong earnings growth often attract momentum investors. Positive quarterly results can drive upward price trends.

### Sector Momentum

Certain sectors, like technology or healthcare, might experience strong trends. Investors focus on leading stocks within these booming sectors.

Momentum Investing vs. Value Investing
