What is Momentum Investing?
---------------------------

Momentum investing is a trading strategy where investors buy securities that are performing well and sell those that are underperforming. It's based on the idea that **the trend is your friend** - meaning that stocks with strong performance in the recent past are likely to continue performing well in the near future.

Discover the basics of momentum investing and how to leverage rising stocks for profitable market gains.

### Momentum Investing Meaning Explained

In simple terms, momentum investors focus on stocks with upward or downward price trends. By riding these trends, they aim to maximize short- or medium-term returns.

For instance, if a stock has risen 10% over the last three months due to strong earnings, a momentum investor might buy the stock, expecting the trend to continue.

Key Momentum Investing Strategies
---------------------------------

There are several strategies that traders use to apply momentum investing effectively. Here are the most common ones:

### Relative Strength Strategy

This involves comparing the performance of stocks against their peers or a market index. Investors focus on stocks that show higher relative strength.

**Example**: A stock in the technology sector that outperforms other tech stocks during a market rally may be selected for a momentum portfolio.

### Moving Averages

Investors use moving averages (like 50-day or 200-day) to identify price trends. A stock crossing above its moving average may signal a buy opportunity.

### Earnings Momentum

Stocks with strong earnings growth often attract momentum investors. Positive quarterly results can drive upward price trends.

### Sector Momentum

Certain sectors, like technology or healthcare, might experience strong trends. Investors focus on leading stocks within these booming sectors.

Is Momentum Investing Profitable?

Momentum investing can be highly profitable if done correctly, but it comes with risks. Stocks with strong upward trends can reverse quickly, leading to losses.

### Key Factors for Success in Momentum Investing

*   **Timing**: Enter and exit trades at the right time.
