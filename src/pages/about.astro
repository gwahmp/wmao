  <h1><span class="font-normal">About Wikimint </span><br/>Digital Marketing & Business Growth Platform</h1>

  <p><strong>Wikimint</strong> is a digital marketing and business growth platform founded in 2018 by <strong>Selvakumaran Krishnan</strong>. We help entrepreneurs, startups, and small businesses build scalable online systems through structured SEO, web development, and digital marketing strategies.</p>
  
  <p>Our mission is simple: transform websites into long-term digital assets that generate visibility, authority, and sustainable growth.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Our Core Focus: Structured Digital Growth</h2>
  
  <p>Wikimint is built around two growth pathways — the <strong>Assisted Business Kit</strong> and the <strong>DIY Business Kit</strong>. Both are designed to help businesses improve online presence, attract qualified traffic, and convert visitors into customers using ethical, data-driven strategies.</p>
  
  <h3>Assisted Business Kit – Expert-Led Growth</h3>
  
  <p>The <a href="/business-growth-services">Assisted Business Services</a> is a hands-on, implementation-focused growth solution. We actively support businesses with:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>SEO strategy and on-page optimization</li>
    <li>Website development and performance improvement</li>
    <li>Content marketing systems</li>
    <li>Technical SEO implementation</li>
    <li>Conversion-focused design enhancements</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This solution is ideal for business owners who want expert execution instead of managing every technical detail themselves.</p>
  
  <h3>DIY Business Kit – Guided Self-Growth</h3>
  
  <p>The <a href="/business-resources">DIY Business Kit</a> empowers entrepreneurs to grow independently using curated free tools, open-source resources, structured blog guides, and actionable marketing frameworks, all contained in our <a href="/tools">free tools directory</a>. It is designed for founders who prefer learning and implementing at their own pace while following proven growth systems.</p>
  
  
  <h2>How Wikimint Helps Businesses Grow Online</h2>
  
  <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
  <p>We implement modern SEO strategies aligned with search intent, user experience, and technical excellence. Our approach focuses on sustainable organic visibility through structured keyword targeting, internal linking, schema implementation, and helpful content creation.</p>
  
  <h3>Conversion-Focused Web Development</h3>
  <p>A website should be more than an online brochure. Wikimint builds and optimizes fast, clean, and scalable websites designed to support marketing performance, improve engagement, and increase lead generation.</p>

  <p>We help businesses create valuable, search-optimized content that builds topical authority. By aligning content with real user problems and business objectives, we turn blogs and landing pages into long-term growth channels.</p>
